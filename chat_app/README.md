## React Native Application
To setup initially, make sure you have node installed.

Make sure you also have expo-cli installed ("npm install expo-cli --global" on windows). 

From within this directory run "npm install" for first time setup and then npm start to run the development server. From the web browser development tool you can launch and debug the app on a web browser, a mobile device, or an android emulator if you have android studio.
